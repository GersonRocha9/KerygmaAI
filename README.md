## 📋 Meaning of the Name

**KerygmaAI** combines two powerful concepts:

- **Kerygma** (κήρυγμα): Greek word meaning "proclamation" or "announcement," often used to refer to the proclamation of the Gospel in Christianity. It is the act of announcing the Christian message in a clear and accessible way.

- **AI** (Artificial Intelligence): Represents the artificial intelligence technology that enables the generation of personalized content.

The name symbolizes the application's mission: to use modern technology (AI) to assist in the proclamation and reflection on Christian teachings, making them more accessible and personalized for users' daily lives.
